## Setup

1. Clone this repository
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/intense123/social-intelligence-builder.git
   cd social-intelligence-builder
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment
   ```
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install dependencies
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Create a `.env` file with your OpenAI API key
   ```
   cp .env-example .env
   # Edit .env and add your OpenAI API key
   ```

## Usage

1. Start the Flask server
   ```
   python app.py
   ```

2. The server will run on http://localhost:5001

3. To expose your local server to the internet (for OMI integration), use ngrok:
   ```
   ngrok http 5001
   ```

4. Configure your OMI memory trigger to point to your ngrok URL + `/memory-trigger`
   Example: `https://your-ngrok-url.ngrok.io/memory-trigger`

5. Visit `/dashboard` to view your social intelligence insights
